# UWP-Music-List-App

A music list app I created to teach my class UWP.

It consists of three lists with a song name, song lyrics and the song itself.

To complete the exercise:
a) Ensure when any song is clicked, the corresponding song in the other two lists is selected
b) Investigate whether itâ€™s possible to play the mp3 music files using UWP and implement it.
